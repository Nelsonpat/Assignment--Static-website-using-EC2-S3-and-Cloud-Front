# Assignment--Static-website-using-EC2-S3-and-Cloud-Front

Cloud Engineer Bootcamp (AWS, Azure and GCP)

Milestone 2: Becoming an AWS Expert

Skills: AWS Administration, Reliability And Bussiness Continuity

**Problem Statement**

Hosting a static website in a non-cloud environment presents challenges in infrastructure setup, scalability, high availability, cost optimization, and security. Users encounter complexities in configuring hardware, lack scalability options, struggle to ensure availability and redundancy, face difficulties in managing costs and resources efficiently, and must handle security and updates manually. Simplifying infrastructure management, providing scalability and redundancy, optimizing costs, and ensuring robust security are essential for successful hosting in non-cloud environments.

By utilizing AWS Cloud services such as EC2, S3, and CloudFront, businesses and individuals can overcome numerous challenges linked to constructing and maintaining static websites. These services provide cost efficiency, scalability, high availability, global content delivery, simplified infrastructure management, enhanced security, and streamlined deployment processes. This empowers businesses to concentrate on their core objectives while delivering an optimized and dependable user experience.

**Objectives**

**Your focus in this project should be on the following:**

-   Understand static websites and their benefits, use cases.
-   Familiarize yourself with EC2, S3, and CloudFront services. Set up and configure an EC2 instance for hosting.
-   Manage website content by creating an S3 bucket and uploading files. Configure CloudFront to serve content from the S3 bucket.
-   Configure DNS settings for routing traffic to CloudFront.
-   Test and troubleshoot the website for proper functionality.
-   Implement security measures and access controls for EC2, S3, and CloudFront.
-   Document the project and deploy the website, following best practices.

**Deliverables**

-   A comprehensive document detailing the project scope, objectives, and steps taken to build the website.
-   A fully functioning static website with intended content. A properly configured EC2 instance for hosting the website.
-   An S3 bucket containing all the website assets, set up for secure and efficient content hosting.
-   A properly configured CloudFront distribution for efficient content delivery. DNS settings configured to route traffic to the website through CloudFront.
-   Thoroughly tested website to ensure proper functionality and responsiveness.
-   Analysis of cost optimization strategies implemented during the project. Implemented security measures for protecting the website and managing access.
-   Clear instructions on how to deploy the website, update content, and troubleshoot issues.

**Tasks/Activities List**

-   Research and gather requirements for the static website.
-   Create an EC2 instance and configure it with the desired specifications.
-   Install and set up web server software on the EC2 instance.
-   Create an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting.
-   Upload the static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the S3 bucket.
-   Set up proper permissions and access controls for the S3 bucket.
-   Create a CloudFront distribution and configure it to use the S3 bucket as the origin.
-   Configure caching settings, SSL/TLS, and other desired options for the CloudFront distribution.
-   Set up DNS records to point the website domain to the CloudFront distribution.
-   Test the website functionality and ensure proper content delivery through CloudFront.
-   Implement security measures such as enabling encryption and configuring access control.
-   Optimize costs by selecting appropriate instance types, storage options, and caching settings.
-   Deploy the static website and verify its accessibility and performance.
-   Conduct thorough testing to ensure the website functions as expected across different devices and browsers.
-   Monitor and maintain the website, periodically checking for updates or necessary adjustments.

**Success Metrics**

-   Choose the right EC2 instance type (25%).
-   Properly configure security groups for EC2 (25%).
-   Configure appropriate permissions for S3 buckets (25%).
-   Configure CloudFront correctly and demonstrate proper content routing (25%).

**Bonus Points**

-   The project documentation includes lessons learned and additional research topics that learners explored to aid in the successful completion of the project.

**Submission Process**

-   Project documentation that shows the successful implementation steps along with the screenshot of outcome such as website functionality, security configuration, S3 bucket permissions.
