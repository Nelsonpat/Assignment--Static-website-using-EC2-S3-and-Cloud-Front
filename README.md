**Problem Statement**

Hosting a static website in a non-cloud environment presents challenges in infrastructure setup, scalability, high availability, cost optimization, and security. Users encounter complexities in configuring hardware, lack scalability options, struggle to ensure availability and redundancy, face difficulties in managing costs and resources efficiently, and must handle security and updates manually. Simplifying infrastructure management, providing scalability and redundancy, optimizing costs, and ensuring robust security are essential for successful hosting in non-cloud environments.

By utilizing AWS Cloud services such as EC2, S3, and CloudFront, businesses and individuals can overcome numerous challenges linked to constructing and maintaining static websites. These services provide cost efficiency, scalability, high availability, global content delivery, simplified infrastructure management, enhanced security, and streamlined deployment processes. This empowers businesses to concentrate on their core objectives while delivering an optimized and dependable user experience.
